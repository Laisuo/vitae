* Served as a techaing assitant for a CMU Mechanical Engineering Core Course (Mechanical System Exprimental). The main job includes helping students conduct experiment, holding office hours, answering questions from students, grading lab reports, etc. 
* I served as the head TA for our TA/CA team. A head TA is needed becasue We have 10 TAs/CAs and graders in total(There are over 160 undergrades who are taking this course). To make the course go smoothly, I made many extra efforts to ensure the course and labs go smoothly, including arranging TA meetings, assigning TA tasks, leading conversation between teachers and other TAs/CAs, etc.
