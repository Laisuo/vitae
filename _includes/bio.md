# Biography
I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, Mechanical Engineering Department. My research interest lies at Materials Synthesizing, Characterization, and Application that are related to renewable energy under the guidance of [Prof. B. Reeja Jayan](http://jayanlab.com/). Currently, my research is focused on surface and interface of energy related materials. To be a little bit more specific, I are engineering the surface of battery electrodes via initiated chemical vapor depostion (iCVD) polymerizaiton, during which a nanoscale polymer thin film is built, and I am trying to improve the performance of lithium ion batteries like life-span, rate capability, and safety.
