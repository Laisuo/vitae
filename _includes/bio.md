# Biography
I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, Mechanical Engineering Department. My research interest lies at **polymers synthesis their applications**, **renewable energies (especially energy storage)**, **synchrotron x-ray experiments**. My PhD thesis advisor is **[Prof. B. Reeja Jayan](http://jayanlab.com/)**, who graduated from **[Prof. Arumugam Manthiram](http://sites.utexas.edu/manthiram/)**'s lab and did her postdoc in **[Prof. Karen Gleason](http://web.mit.edu/gleason-lab/)**'s lab. My PhD work combines the battery studies in Prof. Manthiram's group and vapor phase polymer synthesis in Prof. Gleason's group. My research focuses on engineering surface and interface of cathodes in lithium ion batteries via functional polymers.   

I like research and feel very happy and excited every time when I got a good result, even though it is a very tiny result (mostly of time). I enjoy the pleasure that research brings to me. I would like to stay in academic and I am looking for a postdoc position.
