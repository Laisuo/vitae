# Biography (Dec. 2020 updated)
I am a 5th-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, Mechanical Engineering Department. My PhD thesis advisor is **[Prof. B. Reeja Jayan](http://jayanlab.com/)**, who graduated from **[Prof. Arumugam Manthiram](http://sites.utexas.edu/manthiram/)**'s lab and did her postdoc in **[Prof. Karen Gleason](http://web.mit.edu/gleason-lab/)**'s lab. My PhD work combines the battery studies in Prof. Manthiram's group and vapor phase polymer synthesis in Prof. Gleason's group. TO be more specific, my Ph.D. research is on the topic of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). I engineer the electrode-electrolyte-interface in LIBs and uncover the improved electrochemical performance mechanisms using various experimental tools and density functional theory calculations. Additionally, I have applied various synchrotron X-ray techniques, neutron techniques, and machine learning algorithms in my research. Thus, my expertise and interest include **energy storage devices**, **surface and interface engineering**, **materials synthesis and characterization**, **synchrotron X-ray techniques**, and **machine learning**.

I enjoy academic research and feel very happy and excited whenever I got a good result, even though it is a very tiny result (most of the time). I really enjoy the pleasure that research brings me, which cannot be from anything else. I would like to stay in academic and I am looking for a postdoc position.
