# Biography (Dec 2020 updated)
I am a 5th-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, Mechanical Engineering Department. My PhD thesis advisor is [Prof. B. Reeja Jayan](http://jayanlab.com/), who graduated from [Prof. Arumugam Manthiram](http://sites.utexas.edu/manthiram/)'s lab and did her postdoc in [Prof. Karen Gleason](http://web.mit.edu/gleason-lab/)'s lab. My PhD work combines the battery studies in Prof. Manthiram's group and vapor phase polymer synthesis in Prof. Gleason's group. To be more specific, I engineer the electrode-electrolyte-interface in LIBs using polymers and uncover the improved electrochemical performance mechanisms using various experimental tools and density functional theory calculations. Additionally, I have applied various synchrotron X-ray techniques, neutron techniques, and machine learning algorithms in my research. **My expertise and interest include energy storage devices, surface and interface engineering, materials synthesis and characterization, synchrotron X-ray techniques, and machine learning**.

I enjoy academic research and feel excited whenever I get a good result, even though it is a very tiny one (most of the time). The pleasure that research brings me cannot be obtained from anything else. **I would like to stay in academic and I am looking for a postdoc position.**
